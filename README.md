## 🔥 About the project
This is an Italian cuisine app where users can see, add, edit, delete, and change the availability of delicious dishes

## 🌵 Fake API with JSON Server
We will use JSON server to simulate a REST API that will make the data in the `server.json` file available in the `http://localhost:3333/foods` 

## 👨🏽‍💻 About the challenge
This was a refactoring challenge where I had to migrate a React application from javascript to typescript, and from Class Components to Function Components

## 💻 Installation and execution
To install: `yarn install`<br>
To create fake API with JSON sevrer: `yarn server`<br>
To run the React App: `yarn start`
